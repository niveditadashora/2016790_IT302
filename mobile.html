    <p>
      A mobile phone is a portable telephone that can make and receive calls
      over a radio frequency link while the user is moving within a telephone
      service area. The radio frequency link establishes a connection to the
      switching systems of a mobile phone operator, which provides access to the
      public switched telephone network (PSTN). Modern mobile telephone services
      use a cellular network architecture and, therefore, mobile telephones are
      called cellular telephones or cell phones in North America. In addition to
      telephony, digital mobile phones support a variety of other services, such
      as text messaging, multimedia messagIng, email, Internet access (via LTE,
      5G NR or Wi-Fi), short-range wireless communications (infrared,
      Bluetooth), satellite access (navigation, messaging connectivity),
      business applications, video games and digital photography. Mobile phones
      offering only those capabilities are known as feature phones; mobile
      phones which offer greatly advanced computing capabilities are referred to
      as smartphones.
