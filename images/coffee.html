    <p>
      Coffee is a drink prepared from roasted coffee beans. Darkly colored,
      bitter, and slightly acidic, coffee has a stimulating effect on humans,
      primarily due to its caffeine content. It has the highest sales in the
      world market for hot drinks. Seeds of the Coffea plant's fruits are
      separated to produce unroasted green coffee beans. The beans are roasted
      and then ground into fine particles that are typically steeped in hot
      water before being filtered out, producing a cup of coffee. It is usually
      served hot, although chilled or iced coffee is common. Coffee can be
      prepared and presented in a variety of ways (e.g., espresso, French press,
      caff√® latte, or already-brewed canned coffee). Sugar, sugar substitutes,
      milk, and cream are often used to mask the bitter taste or enhance the
      flavor.
