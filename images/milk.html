      Milk is a white liquid food produced by the mammary glands of mammals. It
      is the primary source of nutrition for young mammals (including breastfed
      human infants) before they are able to digest solid food. Immune factors
      and immune-modulating components in milk contribute to milk immunity.
      Early-lactation milk, which is called colostrum, contains antibodies that
      strengthen the immune system, and thus reduces the risk of many diseases.
      Milk contains many nutrients, including protein and lactose.
